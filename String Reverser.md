# Word Reverser 🔄

A simple pseudocode program that reverses the order of words in a sentence while keeping each word intact.  
Great example of **string manipulation, iteration, and selection** in action.

## ⚡ How it works
- Uses **string manipulation** (`MID`, `LENGTH`) to detect spaces and extract words.  
- Iterates through the string **backwards** using a `FOR` loop.  
- Rebuilds the sentence by appending words in reverse order.  
- Starts with an **empty string** (`""`) to avoid leading spaces.  
- Demonstrates **loops, conditionals, string slicing, and concatenation**.

## 🛠️ Code
The pseudocode is structured with clear indentation and can be adapted to any programming language easily.
